\index{Ranking test!BIC}

The objective of this Use Case is to help to make a choice between several distributions fitted to a numerical sample. This choice can be motivated by :
\begin{itemize}
\item the ranking by the Kolmogorov p-values (for continuous distributions),
\item the ranking by the ChiSquared p-values (for discrete distributions),
\item the ranking BIC values.
\end{itemize}


Details on the BIC criterion may be found in the Reference Guide (\extref{ReferenceGuide}{see file Reference Guide - Step B -- Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)}{stepB}).\\

It does not  require to  specify the parameters of the different models tested. It is possible to precise :
\begin{itemize}
\item the model only : in that case, OpenTURNS builds a factory for each model. OpenTURNS first evaluates  the parameters of the distribution (through the maximum likelihood rule or the moment based one) and then  ranks the distributions according to the criteria selected,
\item the complete distributions with their parameters : OpenTURNS only evaluates the selected criteria  on each of them and rank them.
\end{itemize}
Note that it is possible to specify a KernelSmoothing distribution in the list of the models tested.
