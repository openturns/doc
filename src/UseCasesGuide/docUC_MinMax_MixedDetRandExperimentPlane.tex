The objective of this Use Case is to  create a deterministic design of experiments  which levels are defined from the probabilistic distribution of the input random vector.\\


Details on design of experiments   may be found in the Reference Guide (\extref{ReferenceGuide}{see files Reference Guide - Step C -- Min-Max approach using Design of Experimentss }{stepC}).\\

The example here is an axial design of experiments  where levels are proportionnal to the standard deviation of each component of the random input vector, and centered on the mean vector of the random input vector. Be carefull to remain within the range of the distribution if the latter is bounded!\\
There are three levels  : +/-1, +/-2, +/-3 around a center fixed equal to the center point ($\vect{0}$).\\
The dilatation vector is composed of the standard deviation of each component of the random input vector.\\
