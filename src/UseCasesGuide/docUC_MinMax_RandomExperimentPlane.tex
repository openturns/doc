The objective of this Use Case is to define a random design of experiments  : the design of experiments  does not follow a specified scheme any more. The experiment grid is generated according to a specified distribution and a specified number of points.\\


Details on design of experiments  may be found in the Reference Guide (\extref{ReferenceGuide}{see files Reference Guide - Step C -- Min-Max approach using Designs Of Experiment}{stepC}).\\


OpenTURNS proposes many sampling methods to generate the experiment grid, two of them will be detailed here:
\begin{itemize}
\item the Monte Carlo method: the numerical sample is generated by sampling the specified distribution. When recalled, the {\itshape generate} method regenerates a new numerical sample.
\item the LHS method: the numerical sample is generated by sampling the specified distribution with the LHS technique:  some cells are determined, with the same probabilistic content according to the specified distribution, each line and each column contains exactly one cell, then points are selected among these selected cells. When recalled, the {\itshape generate} method regenerates a new numerical sample: the point selection within the cells changes but not the cells selection. To change the cell selection, it is necessary to create a new LHS Experiment.
\end{itemize}

Before any simulation, it is usefull to initialize the state of the random generator, as defined in the Use Case \ref{randomGenerator}.\\
