\index{Design of Experiments !Fixed design of experiments }

The objective of this Use Case is to enable to re-use a design of experiments , previously elaborated.\\

Details on design of experiments   may be found in the Reference Guide (\extref{ReferenceGuide}{see files Reference Guide - Step C -- Min-Max approach using Design of Experimentss }{stepC}).\\


This functionality is particularly interesting in the polynomial chaos technique, where the evaluation of the coefficients by regression requires the discretisation of a particular integral : to do that, the User may want to re-use a pre-existing numerical sample (for example, the sparse Smolyak grid) to parameterize algorithms which work with design of experiments  structure (and not numerical sample one).\\

When recalled, the {\itshape generate} method regives the specified numerical sample.\\


\requirements{
  \begin{description}
  \item[$\bullet$] the previously elaborated  numerical sample : {\itshape mySample}
  \item[type:] NumericalSample
  \end{description}
}
             {
               \begin{description}
               \item[$\bullet$] the experiment based on the numerical sample : {\itshape myFixedExperiment}
               \item[type:] FixedExperiment
               \end{description}
             }

             Python script for this UseCase :

             \begin{lstlisting}
               # Create a fixed design of experiments
               myFixedExperiment = FixedExperiment(mySample)
